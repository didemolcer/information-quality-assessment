<p style="text-align: justify;">The study investigates the impact of <i>textual and content-based features</i> in predicting the quality of health-related texts. The experiments were conducted for websites about type-2 diabetes and mainly focuses on assessing the quality of written information about treatment choices.</p>
<ul>
<li>Which textual features reveal the quality of health websites? Are the linguistic styles of high-quality websites different from those of low-quality websites?
<ul>
<li>Are textual features derived from professional health literacy guidelines useful in assessing the quality of websites?</li>
<li>Is there any relationship between the frequencies of certain sentence types and the quality of websites? How is the number of auxiliary verbs related to the quality of websites?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How are content-based features related to the quality and coverage of websites?</li>
<li>Does the use of both textual and content-based features perform better than the sole use of textual or content-based features in the classification of websites in terms of quality?</li>
</ul>
